"""System-franchise drafting AI. Pure.

Fairness rule: franchises draft through the SAME mechanism as humans — each pick they are offered 11 random available
cricketers (never the full pool) and choose one. The only differences are (a) they see hidden ratings, exactly like the
match engine does, and (b) a role-repair safety net: when a hard need (a keeper, enough bowlers) could otherwise not be met
in the remaining rounds, the offer is guaranteed to contain a card of that role. The repair never adds *strength* —
it only guarantees a playable shape, and humans may still pick 11 batters if they want.
