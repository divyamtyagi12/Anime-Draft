# 🎮 GAME ARENA — ⚔️ Anime Draft + 🔢 Number Wars (Telegram multiplayer bot)

`/start` in a group shows a picker: **⚔️ Anime Draft** or **🔢 Number Wars**. Only the person who sent `/start` (or a group admin) chooses. One game per group at a time — enforced in the database for both games.

## 🎴 ANIME DRAFT

Lobby in a **group**, drafting and battles in each player's **DM**.
Franchises: **Re:ZERO · Black Clover · Death Note · Ben 10** (81 characters, 5 categories). Ben 10 includes the main cast, villains and Omnitrix aliens as draftable cards.

Python 3.12 · python-telegram-bot (async) · Supabase/PostgreSQL · long polling (webhook-ready).

## Game flow
1. `/start` in a group → pick **Anime Draft** → lobby (⚔️ JOIN / 🚪 LEAVE / 🔥 FORCE START). 3–8 players. Joining requires having pressed Start in the bot's DM.
2. FORCE START (host/admin) → every player is DM-checked, the lobby locks, and each player drafts 5 characters (5 random offers per category). Progress (✅/⏳, never characters) is shown in the group.
3. Round-robin league: each match = 5 clashes, fought privately with live-edited DM cards and a scorecard to both players. The group only gets the standings table (edited in place after each round).
4. Top two → Grand Final (3+ clashes wins; no ties possible with 5 clashes). Champion announced in the group.

Scoring: win 3 / loss 0 (5 clashes → no draws). Ranking: points → clash difference → clashes won → head-to-head → deterministic random.

```

## 1. Supabase setup
1. Create a project at supabase.com.
2. **SQL Editor → paste `database/schema.sql` → Run.** (Re-runnable.)
   Then **paste `database/number_wars.sql` → Run** (Re-runnable; must come second — the bot refuses to start without it).
3. Characters are upserted automatically on bot start (`AUTO_SEED=true`). Alternatives: run `database/seed_characters.sql` in the SQL Editor, or `python -m scripts.seed_characters`.
4. **Project Settings → API**: copy the *Project URL* and the **`service_role` key**.
   - `SUPABASE_KEY` must be the **service_role** key. RLS is enabled with no policies, so the anon key cannot work (by design — it also can't read your data).
   - It is a server-side secret: never put it in a frontend, a Telegram message, or Git.

## 2. Telegram / BotFather setup
1. `@BotFather` → `/newbot` → copy the token.
2. `/setjoingroups` → Enable. (Privacy mode can stay ON; the bot only needs commands and buttons.)
3. Commands (the bot also sets these itself on startup; `/setcommands` is optional):
```
start - Create a game (group) / register (DM)
help - Show commands
rules - How the game works
team - Show your drafted team (DM)
draft - Resend your current draft prompt (DM)
table - League standings
status - Current game status
cancelgame - Cancel the game (host/admin)
```
4. Add the bot to your group. Every player must open the bot privately and press **Start** once.

## 3. Run locally
```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # fill TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY
python bot.py
```
Optional env vars are documented in `.env.example` (MIN_PLAYERS, MAX_PLAYERS, CLASH_DELAY, DRAFT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES, OWNER_IDS…).

## 4. Testing
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest          # or: python -m tests.run_all (no pytest needed)
```
Unit tests cover round-robin generation, ranking/tiebreaks, battle fairness, draft offers (incl. worst-case pool exhaustion), data validation, and message rendering.

Manual end-to-end test: you need 3 Telegram accounts (or set `MIN_PLAYERS=2` and use 2). Suggested checklist: join twice (rejected), join without DM start (prompted), non-host FORCE START (rejected), double-tap a draft button, kill the bot mid-draft / mid-league and restart (it resumes), `/cancelgame`, `/table`, `/status`, `/team`. Set `CLASH_DELAY=0.5` for faster runs.

## 5. Artwork
No artwork ships with the bot (I can't verify image rights/URLs). Put direct image URLs in `data/image_urls.json` (`{"reinhard": "https://…"}`), or reply to a photo with `/setimage reinhard` (user ids in `OWNER_IDS` only). After the first successful send the Telegram `file_id` is cached in Supabase. The draft shows an album only when all five offered characters have artwork; otherwise it's text-only. Everything image-related lives in `services/images.py`.

## 6. Tuning characters
Edit `data/characters.py` (ratings 1–100, eligible categories, abilities) and restart; stats are re-synced. Ratings are judgement calls — Death Note characters are Intelligence-only on purpose. Battle constants (±5 % clash randomness, tiebreak formula) are at the top of `game/battle.py`.

## Reliability design
- **Everything important lives in Supabase**; a restart resumes drafts (prompts re-sent if lost), the league (orphaned matches reset, undelivered scorecards sent) and unannounced finals.
- **Atomic transitions** via Postgres functions with row locks: join/leave, LOBBY→DRAFTING, DRAFTING→LEAGUE, LEAGUE→FINAL, and `finish_match` (points awarded once). Unique constraints stop duplicate joins, double picks, duplicate finals, and a second lobby per group. Matches are claimed `PENDING→RUNNING` with a conditional update.
- Every callback is answered; stale buttons get a friendly message; Telegram rate limits (`AIORateLimiter` + RetryAfter handling), blocked users, deleted messages and Supabase network failures are handled per-player so one failure never crashes the bot.
- Idle drafters are auto-picked after `DRAFT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`.
- Logs redact the token/keys (and httpx URL logging is silenced).

## Deployment notes
- **Run exactly one instance** (the league runner is an in-process task guarded by DB state; two instances would fight over polling anyway).
- Webhook: set `RUN_MODE=webhook`, `WEBHOOK_URL=https://your.domain`, a non-guessable `WEBHOOK_PATH`, a random `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and put TLS in front (reverse proxy) forwarding to `WEBHOOK_PORT`.
- Docker sketch: `FROM python:3.12-slim`, `COPY . /app`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `CMD ["python","bot.py"]`; pass secrets as env vars (Railway/Fly/Render/systemd) — never bake `.env` into an image.
- Back up the Supabase project as usual; game history stays in `games/matches/match_clashes`.

## 🏆 Leaderboard

`/leaderboard` (or the 🏆 button under `/start` in DM) opens the Global / Group boards.
Everything lives in Supabase, so it survives restarts. **Upgrade:** re-run `database/schema.sql`
(idempotent) in the Supabase SQL editor, then restart the bot.

* **When:** after the Grand Final, `announce_final` calls `record_game_results` (one atomic SQL
  function, guarded by `games.leaderboard_processed` + `unique(user_id, game_id)` in `rating_history`),
  then posts the championship with rating changes and buttons. Cancelled/unfinished games never count.
* **Rating (global):** everyone starts at 1000. Pairwise Elo over the final placement
  (champion, runner-up, then league-table order): for each opponent `S = 1` if you finished above
  them else `0`, `E = 1/(1+10^((R_opp−R_me)/400))`, `change = round(32/(N−1) · Σ(S−E))`.
  Beating stronger players pays more; losing to weaker ones costs more. Spec + tests: `game/rating.py`.
* **Group boards:** keyed by Telegram chat id, rank by Championships (default), Total wins or Win rate
  (win rate needs 5+ league matches). Matches W/D/L are league matches; clashes include the final.
* **Ties:** equal keys share a rank (1, 2, 2, 4); order inside a tie is by user id so pages are stable.
* **Old games:** finished before the upgrade → not counted. To count them, run
  `update games set leaderboard_processed = false where status = 'COMPLETED';` and restart
  (they are applied oldest-first).


## 🔢 NUMBER WARS

Everyone secretly picks 0–100 in a private chat. **Target = Average × 0.8**; the closest number wins the round.

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| Closest number (ties share it) | no damage |
| Other valid submissions | −1 HP |
| Exact target match (mathematically exact, not rounded) | +2 HP, max 10 |
| No submission | −2 HP, excluded from the average |
| HP reaches 0 | eliminated — last player standing is champion 👑 |

Edge rules: **one submitter** → wins, others −2, no bonus · **nobody submits** → no target, all −2 ·
**3 zero-damage rounds in a row** → ⚡ sudden death with a random multiplier (0.5/0.8/1.2/1.5) stored *before* the round ·
**30-round cap** → rank by HP → round wins → lowest total distance (ties = joint champions) ·
**everyone knocked out together** → best *pre-round* HP → round wins → distance.
Rating: start 1000, +25 outright win, +10 shared title, −5 completed loss, cancelled = 0.

Flow: `/start` → 🔢 Number Wars → JOIN (3–20 players; must have started the bot in DM) → START (host/admin) or auto-start
`NW_LOBBY_COUNTDOWN`s after the minimum is reached → each round the bot DMs a selector (−10/−1/+1/+10, presets, 🔒 LOCK) —
or just type a number and confirm. The group sees one message per round that turns into the results.
Commands: `/nwrules`, `/nwstats`, `/status`, `/cancelgame`, and a 🔢 board inside `/leaderboard`.

**Anti-cheat / reliability.** Submissions use the Telegram-signed sender (never a payload field); deadlines use the *database*
clock; a submit and a round-close are serialised by a row lock so nothing lands "in between"; each round is applied once by an
atomic SQL function (HP, wins, elimination, final result and ratings in one transaction); unfinished rounds resume after a restart
from their persisted deadline. One asyncio task per *match*, not per player. Hidden numbers are never shown before the round ends.

Code map: `game/number_wars.py` (pure rules) · `services/number_wars_service.py` (lobby, round loop, recovery) ·
`handlers/number_wars.py` + `handlers/arena.py` (Telegram) · `repositories/number_wars.py` · `database/number_wars.sql` ·
`utils/nw_messages.py`. Tests: `tests/test_number_wars*.py` (rules, end-to-end match flow with fakes, message limits).
